# Introduction-to-R

This is a short course about R and Rstudio. The course has three sessions:   
Session 1 basic syntax   
Session 2 data manipulation and plotting  
Session 3 basic statistics  

Please download Data.xlsx, which is coupled with the R script. The data contains information about some basic soil properties after application of compost and biochar, with low and high doses.  

Note: you need to set your working directory that contains the data and your R script.
