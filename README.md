# Introduction-to-R

This is a short course about R and Rstudio. The course has three sessions:   
Session 1 basic syntax   
Session 2 data manipulation and plotting  
Session 3 basic statistics  

**The powerpoints show the content for each session, and the html files contain the practices in Rstudio**  

Regarding how to download and install R and RStudio, please refer to the file "Installation.html"  

Please download Data.xlsx and IC.xlsx, which are coupled with the R script.  
Data.xlsx is used for the whole three sessions. The data contains information about some basic soil properties after application of compost and biochar, with low and high doses.   
IC.xlsx is used for the session 2.  

Below are the packages you need to install for your RStudio:  
install.packages(readxl)  
install.packages(dplyr)  
install.packages(ggplot2)  
install.packages(openxlsx)  
install.packages(car)  
install.packages(ggpubr)  
install.packages(rstatix)  

Note: you need to set your working directory that contains the data and your R script.
